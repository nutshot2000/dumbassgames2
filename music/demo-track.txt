# DEMO TRACK PLACEHOLDER

This is where your GXSCC converted 8-bit music files will go!

For now, the music player will gracefully handle missing files and skip to the next track.

## To Add Your Own Tracks:

1. Convert MIDI files using GXSCC
2. Export as MP3 or WAV
3. Place files in this /music directory
4. Update the playlist in script.js

Example files the player is looking for:
- retro-dreams.mp3
- cyber-highway.wav  
- neon-nights.mp3
- pixel-paradise.mp3
- arcade-fever.mp3

The music player will automatically handle missing files!
